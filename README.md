# Recreational Mathematics

This repository contains several short programs I wrote that each play around with random recreational math problems. Many of these programs are directly inspired from watching Numberphile videos.

Each directory contains contains a program file that responds to a given problem outlined in a README.md file. Feel free to dive into as many problem directories you wish!
