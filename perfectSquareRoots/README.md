# Perfect Square Roots

Find the square root of any given perfect square without multiplication or division.

This is possible as all perfect squares are the sum of odd integers [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_number). This arithmetic sequence can be seen below:
```
1 = 1
4 = 1 + 3
9 = 1 + 3 + 5
16 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7
25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9
```
We can find a square root of a perfect square by counting the times we add odd increasing numbers to equal a perfect square.

Below is a program I wrote when introduced to this very problem in a weekly challenge at Replit.com [[2]](https://replit.com/talk/announcements/Weekly-Challenge-1/142232).
Given how I am extremely into recreational mathematics, I couldn't help by give a go at this challenge!
I also decided that I might learn a few more Python hacks, such as writing multiple statements on one line [[3]](https://tutorialspoint.com/How-to-provide-multiple-statements-on-a-single-line-in-Python)[[4]](https://note.nkmk.me/en/python-multi-variables-values).
